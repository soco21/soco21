# Assignment 3

## Exercise 1

### Task

Choose two design patterns among those that we cover in class until the lecture on Nov 23 (included),
excluding the pattern you already implemented in Assignment 2 (e.g., Singleton). For each chosen design
pattern, you must have a corresponding implementation in your code. If not, refactor your code to include
it. Then, complete the following points:

### Design Pattern 1

#### Task 1

Write a natural language description of why and how the pattern is implemented in your code.

#### Description of why and how the pattern is implemented

For exercise 3, we would like to implement the undo command. For that we need a way to store
the mutations of the board in a list, that we can undo them later. Currently, we have 3 mutations which
are possible on the board:
1. Move a piece from BoardCoordinates A to BoardCoordinates B.
2. Make a jump move from BoardCoordinates A to BoardCoordinates C, which removes the Piece at BoardCoordinates B between
A and C.
3. When a jump gamble is lost, just remove the piece at the start of the jump move.

Additionally, both of them may result in a pawn being converted to a king.
In this step, instead of directly mutating the Board in the `Board::executeMove` method,
we will construct a command, then execute it. Later in exercise 3, we will store the executed command
at the end of the command list, than we can undo them in the reverse execution order.

We have a special case for the command pattern here, because the Client and the Invoker are the same
class and instance. Board is responsible for creating the correct instance of the Command,
which may be a JumpGambleLostMove, a JumpMove or a SimpleMove. It also sets the Receiver of the Command,
which is the Store, via the constructor of the command. This is the responsibility of the client.
Then it directly executes the command, which is the responsibility of the Invoker.

Below is the image of the command pattern as explained in the lecture to compare with our explanation.

#### Task 2

Make a sequence diagram of how the pattern works dynamically in your code

## Exercise 2

Consider ten important classes in your checkers game.

### Task 1

Describe why these classes are important in your systemâ€™s design and what their current responsibilities are
(you must use UML diagrams to support your description)

#### UML Diagram

#### Description of the 10 most important classes and their responsibilities

### Task 2

Since these are important classes, you want to make sure that they are well tested! Write unit tests
to reach at least 80% line coverage in each of them. If this goal is not achievable (or not important),
you can explain why.

### Task 3

Create a testing report for your system with: (1) line coverage overall and (2) a histogram with the
distribution of the line coverage.

#### Overall line coverage report

#### Histogram of the line coverage distribution


## Exercise 3

### Undo Feature

#### Task 1

Google (used to?) ask their employees to spend 20% of their time at Google on a project that their
job description does not cover. As a result of the 20% Project, Google now has services such as
Gmail and AdSense.
This is your occasion to have similar freedom. You can decide what to do next to your game:5 It can
be an extension/improvement from any perspective, such as improved code quality or novel features.
Define your own requirements and get them approved by your tutor (especially in terms of load).
Afterwards you must implement the requirements.

##### Description of the requirements

#### Task 2

During the analysis and design phases of this extension use responsibility driven design and UML
(push to the repository the single PDF file including all the produced documents)

##### Responsibility Driven Design

##### CRC Cards

##### UML
